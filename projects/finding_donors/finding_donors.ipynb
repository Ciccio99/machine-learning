    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "- App suggestion systems: The various identity marks of a user are used a feature points on which the Decision tree can branch on. Such as age, gender, work status, income level, geographic locations, etc. These discreete features can be used for clean branching in the decisions trees.\n",
    "- Decision Trees maintain a simple model structure and are easy to train. Furthermore, data typically does not need to be normalized because each feature decision is independent from eachother, so there is overall less data setup. Finally, they work best with discrete classifications and are also good for being able to visualize the flow of the decision process to people because of it's simple structure.\n",
    "- Some of the weaknesses of decision trees include: They can become overly complex when there is too many features to analyze, it can incorrectly link independent features together because of one branching mistake, decision trees can easily overfit and if they need to be restricted in depth than they may not reach an optimum point of convergence.\n",
    "- Decision tree would be optimal for this data set due to it's independent features, its discrete classification problem space and the relatively small data set that is involved in this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the many ways that a Random Forest Classifier can be used is to create a product suggestion model. The model uses the description of a person, which could include: age, gender, employment, etc, to identify which product should be suggested to them on a website.\n",
    "- It performs well with data that typically overfits with other models, due to it using multiple decision trees that are trained on random subsets of the features in the dataset. Each tree is unique from the next so that a multitude of feature combinations are considered for the final decision. The final decision is an aggregate of the majority classification made be the decision trees.\n",
    "- Random Forest Classifiers depend on creating many decision trees (hence the \"forest\" int he name name) that are agreggated together. Training all the individual decision trees can take a significant amount of time compared to a simple decision tree or other methods. They tend to do poorly with sparse data sets that can lead to improper node splits leading to incorrect final decision when processing data.\n",
    "- It is large data set that could easily overfit to specific types of working class people that the model thinks has an income of >50K, so using a Random Forest Classifier that creates a variety of decision trees allows the final model to have a more hollistic view of the variety of people in our data set, and properly make a final decision. Furthermore, our dataset is not sparse, there are no features which could contain 0 or NULL data that would cause erronious branching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "- One of the many use cases for SVMs is face detection, where faces can be classified a 1 and non-faces classifed as 0. The models are trained on nXn pixel images where it extracts the features that makeup a face or a non-face.\n",
    "- SVM models uses the kernel method in order to find interesting and non-obvious (non-linear) boundaries in your data. Due to its non-linearity, it can fit more accurate boundaries around its training data.\n",
    "- The biggest drawback is that SVMs tend to be \"black boxes\" due to the kernel method, since data can be extrapolated to higher-dimensions it makes the data less human-readable. So an SVM would not be suited for models that need exemplify a clear decision path.\n",
    "- Since the types of people that can generate an income of >50K can vary widly in attributes, then a non-lineard model, such as an SVM, would be well suited to find accurate boundaries on which people are within that >50K level for our donation program.\n",

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "Random Forest Classifer will be the best model for CharityML due to it's good accuracy of ~82%, it's F-Score of 0.65, and its fast training time of <1 second. SVM could also be a suitable alternative due to having similar accuracy and F-Score to the Random Forest Classifer. Howewever, the SVM model took 17.5 seconds to train compared to the Random Forest's sub-second train time. If the data set were to be scaled up to an even bigger size the SVM would take a prohibitive amount of time to train. Moreover, the quick training time of the Random Forest Classifer allows us to quickly train different hyperparameters to improve its accuracy, while the SVM would take a long time test a variety of parameters.\n",

    "The Random Forest Classifier can be compared to a majority voting system. Where many people will give their decision, and the decision with the highest votes is selected as the correct decision. For random forests, many mini-trees are trained on random subsets of features and data. This allows each tree to provide a unique \"opinion\" on what decision should be made. Each tree essentially works like a game of 20 questions, the tree keeps guessing whether the inputed data should go down the left or right branch. It continues making branch decisions until it finally reaches a lead node (a branch with no other branches). Furthermore, since tree structures are simple, the decision/branch structure of the tree can easily be traced, allowing people to follow the logic of the decision tree themselves."

    "- Unfortunately I only got 2 of out 5 correct, the 2 correct were age and education-num.\n",
    "- Both my rankings and my choices were incorrect. I had age as the last indicator, however it seems that age is the biggest indicator of income. Then I thought education-num would be valued in 2nd place but it was actually valued in last place.\n",
    "- There might be an age where on average more people are making money which is why the indicator is the highest. As time is spent working, people grow in experience and skill which would lead them to higher incomes. Capital-gains are straight profit due to selling property or an investment so it makes sense that if someone makes a very profitable sale then they will most likely have a higher income due to it. Hours-per-week I hesistate to agree with because a minimum wage job can be 40 hours just like a standard software engineering job. So I was assuming that it wouldn't properly represent income, however if the data holds people that work 0 hours a week then that would most likely indiciate a lower income. Marital status can mean that someone in the family provides money for the dependent which typically means they make the most money of the relationship. Finally, the education-num makes sense in 5th place because many college graduates that aren't in high paying fields will most likely enter the work force receiving an income <50k.\n"

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
